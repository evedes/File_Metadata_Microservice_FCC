Hi guys! I'm Eduardo Vedes (@evedes) and I've challenged myself in the first of January to reboot my career in 360 days. I've chosen to pursue a Full Stack Developer career. In order to achieve that I've started studying and practicing along in [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com). I've already completed the Front End Certification Program and now I'm focused on the Back End Cert. I'm learning how to develop solutions with node.js + express + mongoDB.

This is my fifth API Project. I hope you like it!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### OBJECTIVE:
Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://aryanj-file-size.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Glitch.

NOTE: for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Glitch project. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### USER STORIES:

1. I can submit a FormData object that includes a file upload.

2. When I submit something, I will receive the file size in bytes within the JSON response

3. Hint: You may want to use this package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer
